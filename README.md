# First Project

This is my first project using PyCharm for baseball analytics! I created of heat map of Gerrit Cole's pitches between July 1-10 in 2023. I randomly selected a pitcher and dates. The data was taken from MLB's Statcast system and accessed through the pybaseball Python call. I attached my code and the resulting heatmap.
